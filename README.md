# Hot Beans Website

## Brief

The brief asked me to create a profile for the company itself. I have done this by designing the first page of the website to include the company's name, **"Hot Beans"**, clearly displayed at the top of the screen. It also includes a **Contact Us** section at the bottom in case users have any questions.

### **A Profile of the Company**

The homepage of the website serves as the company profile. It introduces the company, includes the name at the top of the screen, and features a contact section for user inquiries.

---

### **Profiles of Existing Trainee Web Developers**

I have included three trainee profiles on the website. By clicking on the **Trainees** tab, users are taken to a dedicated page showcasing these profiles. I have written descriptions for each trainee and included images to enhance the presentation.

### **Job Specifications and Required Qualifications**

The **Job Specifications** page outlines all the responsibilities and qualifications needed to apply for a position at Hot Beans. Applicants should be:

- Skilled in **HTML**, **CSS**, and other coding languages  
- Excellent team players  
- Good at problem-solving  
- Proficient in technology-related knowledge  

This gives potential applicants a clear understanding of what is expected of them if they wish to join the team.

### **Online Application Form**

An online **Application Form** has been created and can be accessed via the **Application** tab. This allows potential candidates to submit their details and explain why they would be a suitable addition to the company.

### **Links to Web Development Courses**

I have included a section with **links to web development courses** to help users enhance their knowledge and prepare for a future career in web development. These resources are especially useful for aspiring developers.

## **Review**

### **Jacob Pooley**

> "I have gone through Adam’s website and overall it is looking very clean and simple. It has all of the pages that it needs and enough information to understand what’s going on.  
>  
> There are a few things that went wrong when I was going through the website:  
> - The information on the first page wasn’t edited and is still in Lorem Ipsum.  
> - The website tab doesn’t take you anywhere.  
>  
> Other than those two negatives, the website is looking really good."

> "The website has a strong structure and is easy to navigate. The content is relevant, and the layout is user-friendly. The inclusion of trainee profiles and job specifications makes it informative for potential applicants.  
>  
> However, I noticed that some links are not functioning correctly, and the visual design could use a bit more polish in terms of color contrast and consistency.  
>  
> With a few adjustments, this will be a very professional-looking site."
