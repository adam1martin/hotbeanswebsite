## Brief

### **A profile of the company itself**
The brief asked me to create aprofile for the company itself, i have done this one the first page of the website, it eve nhas a contact us page at the bottom if you had any questions about them. I have added the companys name at the top of the screen "Hot Beans" so people can clearly see what the company is called.

### **profiles of existing trainee web developers** 
I have added 3 trainee profiles to my page, if you click on the Trainees tab, you will be taken to this page, i created descriptions for them and i even provided images.

### **job specifications and required qualifications**
All of the specifications and the responsibilites you would need to have to apply for the job. Here are the Specifications. Skilled at using Html, CSS and any other coding languages, Great at working in a team, Good probelm-solving Skills and Skilled in Technology Knowledge. I have supplied people with this knowledge so they can get the idea of what specifications they would need to be a part of our team.

### **an on-line application form**
I have created a page for an application form, if you click on the application tab then you will find this, this gives people a chance to tell us a little bit about themself and prove to us that they are what we need.

### **links to web development courses**




## **Review**

## **Jacob Pooley**

I have gone through Adam's website and overall it is looking very clean and simple, it has all of the pages that it needs and enough information to understand whats going on. There are a few things that went wrong when i was going through the website: The information on the first page wasnt edited and is still in lorem impsum and the website tab doesnt take you anywhere. Other than those two negatives, the wesbite is looking really good.
